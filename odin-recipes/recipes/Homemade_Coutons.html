    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The best part about homemade croutons is that you can use your favorite bread, even if it’s gone stale, and your croutons are ready in under 15 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A bread</li>
        <li>olive oil (or melted butter)</li>
        <li>salt</li> 
        <li>pepper</li> 
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>golden edges</li>
        <li>the seasonings bring out the croutons’ best.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tear fresh bread or slice stale bread: Since fresh bread can be so delicate, I found that it’s easier to gently tear fresh bread by hand. Likewise, it’s easier to use a serrated knife to gently see-saw across stale bread.</li>
        <li>Aim for 3/4-inch cubes of bread: This size is just right, yielding croutons that are perfectly bite-sized. They’re nicely crisp on the outside, yet still have a bit of chew on the inside. They’re crisp enough to stand up to dressing, but not so crisp that you’ll break a tooth on them! Don’t worry if you’re croutons aren’t perfect cubes. Irregular, craggy bits are welcome here.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and toss every 5 minutes. This temperature is perfect for developing those golden edges without burning the bread. Croutons are ready in just 10 to 12 minutes at this temperature, so you’ll only have to toss once or twice.</li>
    </ol>
