    <h>Description</h>
    <p>Who doesn’t love a good pizza?! It is the weekend and I am in need for a good pizza! I knew I could whip up a pizza in a snap and have all the toppings I want! I love how easy this pizza is to make and all the flavor that goes along with it. My family loves pizza night and you can’t go wrong with this dough. It is simple to make with only 5 ingredients but packed with so much flavor for the crust. We all love it and enjoy making pizza in our home together.</p>
    <p>This homemade pizza is one that your family will enjoy in the kitchen bringing so many memories baking it together. Let the machine do the work, play a quick game in-between dough raising and make a memory that your family will cherish. This will become a weekly favorite and one of the meals that will carry on through traditions.</p>
    <h>Ingredients</h>
    <ul>warm water
        sugar
        yeast
        Black olives
        Bell Peppers
        Cheese
        Bacon
        Onions
        Sausage
        Mushrooms
        Tomatoes</ul>
    <h>Steps</h>
    <ol>Mix warm water, sugar and yeast together. Let that sit for 5 minutes.
        Add flour and salt to the water, sugar, and yeast. Mix this until smooth and let it raise for 10 minutes. I used my kitchen-aid mixer with the dough hook and it was so easy and worked great!
        Prepare the dough for what you will be making and let rest for another 10 minutes before putting into the oven.
        Spread pizza sauce evenly about an inch from the edge. Top with cheese and desired toppings.
        Bake at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes.</ol>
